# DeFake
DeFake is the Fake news detection machine learning model. It detects the news, extracts the meaningful patterns and make predictions.

# Features
1. Detects fake news using machine learning.  
2. Preprocesses text (stopword removal, stemming, translation).  
3. Uses **TF-IDF** for feature extraction.  
4. Trained with **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.  
5. Achieves high accuracy on labeled datasets.  

# Tech Stack
1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy → Data handling  
3.NLTK, LangDetect, DeepTranslator → NLP processing  
4.Scikit-learn → ML model (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF)

# Future Improvements
1.Implement Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers) for better accuracy.  
2. Use BERT/GPT embeddings for text understanding.  
3. Create a web UI for real-time news classification.
